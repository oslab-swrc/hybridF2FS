# hybridF2FS
A varient of F2FS using hybrid logging with NVM and SSD

## Linux versions supported
Default Branch is 5.7, but Linux Kernel above v3.8 can adopt hybridF2FS by git merge. You can adopt our code to that versions by fixing little conflict.

## Description
F2FS is a Linux file system designed to perform well on Nand-flash based storages such as SSD. F2FS writes Data and Node(File System Metadata) in log-structured manner. It uses multi-head logging(hot-cold separation) to utilize SSD's internal parallelism. But F2FS Design is not optimized to manycore environment. This leads to lack of I/O scalability in manycore server. hybridF2FS suggests scalability solutions for F2FS. In this branch, we suggest the scalability solution for fsync().

hybridF2FS adopt NVM+DRAM hybrid structure to use NVM as metadata storage. For resolving performance degradation caused by fsync, hybridF2FS uses NVM as a node Log and File System Metadata Area. All File System Metadata Area is moved to NVM, so there is no need to flush metadata during Checkpoint. By using NVM's byte-addressability, we enable F2FS to write modified File System Metadata directly to NVM.  As a result, we can improve fsync latency and checkpointing issue in F2FS.

## Requirement List

NVM Node Logging version hybridF2FS and Atomic Range Lock + nCache version hybridF2FS is not compatible.

## HOW TO USE hybridF2FS?

Emulation with Intel PMEM Driver
```

```

### Build Kernel
```
1. sudo cp /boot/config-generic_version .config
2. make menuconfig
3. make -j number_of_cores
4. sudo make modules_install
5. sudo make install
```
### Mount File System
```
1. sudo mkfs.f2fs -f device
2. sudo mount -t f2fs -o pmem=<pmem_device> <device_to_mount> <mount_dir>
ex . sudo mount -t f2fs -o pmem=/dev/pmem0 /dev/nvme0n1 /mnt/f2fs
```

## Developer Guide
Our implementation is about F2FS. If you want to check or modify our code, use c files in fs/f2fs/. If you have questions, feel free to contact us.

### NVM node logging path
For NVM node logging, we adopted balloc.c and balloc.h from NOVA File System. and we mainly modified node.c, checkpoint.c


### How to Change F2FS after modification 
```
1. cd KERNEL_DIRECTORY
2. sudo rmmod f2fs
3. make fs/f2fs/f2fs.ko
4. sudo insmod fs/f2fs/f2fs.ko
```
